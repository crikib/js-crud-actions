Connecting to the frontend

API needs to be deployed on some server (local or remote)

Server rendered
JSON object from the API 
const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
  req.open('GET', '/api/products');
  req.onload = function(){
    const data = JSON.parse(req.response);
    addList({data});
  }
  req.send();

  CRUD
  Create = post 
  read = GET
  update = patch 
  delete = delete

  Client-side validation helps prevent errors


HTTP STATUS CODE GROUPS

  1xx - information
  2xx - success codes
  3xx - redirect
  4xx - client errors
  5xx - server errors
  
Status code is up for debate. 

Error Code (400) - Bad Request (server cannot or will not process the request for something perceived to be client error)
403 - Forbidden(server understood the request but refuses to accept it)
422 - Unprocessible Entity (server understands the content type of the request entity)
